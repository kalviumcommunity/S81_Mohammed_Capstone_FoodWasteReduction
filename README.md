# 🧑‍🍳 **PantryChef** – Your Smart Kitchen Companion 🇮🇳

### *Manage Food Better. Waste Less. Live Smarter.*

**PantryChef** is an intelligent kitchen management tool built specifically for Indian households to tackle one of the biggest challenges — **food waste**. From tracking expiry dates to managing your daily grocery inventory, PantryChef is here to make your kitchen smarter, more efficient, and eco-conscious.

## ✨ **Why PantryChef?**

Food waste isn’t just a personal loss — it’s a global issue. In Indian homes, ingredients are often forgotten at the back of shelves or expire unnoticed. PantryChef ensures **every ingredient is tracked**, **nothing is wasted**, and your kitchen remains **organized and efficient**.

## 🧰 **Core Features That Make PantryChef Stand Out**

### 🗓️ **Expiry Tracking**

Automatically track expiry dates based on item type, quantity, and category. Never let food go bad again!

### 🔔 **Smart Notifications**

Get timely reminders via app, email, or push notifications when items are about to expire. Customize alerts based on urgency and preference.

### 🛒 **Grocery Inventory Management**

Easily add, edit, and organize your groceries. Filter by type (e.g., spices, vegetables, grains) or category (e.g., perishable, packaged) to stay in control of what’s in your kitchen.

### 🖼️ **Profile Photo Upload**

Make your profile uniquely yours. Upload a photo and add a personal touch to your PantryChef account.

### 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**

Get a birds-eye view of your pantry health:

* Items nearing expiry
* Quantity levels
* Recent additions
* Waste statistics (weekly/monthly)

### 🤝 **Community Sharing** *(In Future)*

Help your neighbors and reduce waste! Share near-expiry or excess food items with others nearby through the in-app network.
