### *Manage Food Better. Waste Less. Live Smarter.*

**PantryChef** is an intelligent kitchen management tool built specifically for Indian households to tackle one of the biggest challenges — **food waste**. From tracking expiry dates to managing your daily grocery inventory, PantryChef is here to make your kitchen smarter, more efficient, and eco-conscious.

## ✨ **Why PantryChef?**

Food waste isn’t just a personal loss — it’s a global issue. In Indian homes, ingredients are often forgotten at the back of shelves or expire unnoticed. PantryChef ensures **every ingredient is tracked**, **nothing is wasted**, and your kitchen remains **organized and efficient**.
